My name is [Walter Nelson](https://wjn0.io). I'm a PhD student at IST Austria, supervised by Francesco Locatello and co-supervised by Arthur Gretton at University College London. Right now, I'm mainly finding new ways to make better (use of) foundation models for vision problems in biology.

Most recently, I was a data scientist at the Centre for Data Science and Digital Health at Hamilton Health Sciences in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. There, I mostly worked on applied machine learning for health.

You can find my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CDauX2IAAAAJ) profile. The code for many of them can be found below.
